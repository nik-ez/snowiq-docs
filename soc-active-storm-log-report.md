## Active Storm Log

The Active Storm Log page is an Event Log that allows Admin users a closer look into the actions, users, and timestamps of the actions for a current active Event. As shown below, the log displays the time the action occurred in the system, what the action was, and who performed it (user name or system). Actions may include creating an Assignment, activating a new Phase for a Depot, or changing the status of a Driver.

The default tab 'Storm Event' displays overall county statistics for the Event, along with data such as when the event activated and ended, predicted duration, active staff, miles plowed, total snowfall, and salt usage. More granular reporting can be found in additional tabs including Phase, Route, Driver, and Salt Usage.
