# Road Hazards

A Road Hazard is a marker icon on the map to inform users of reported road hazards. Users can view reported hazards on the map, and can also report new hazards to inform other app users working in the same service area.

  - Select the type of road hazard from the list, then select 'Yes' to confirm.

  - The system will display hazards as either a road plate or a warning, as shown below.
    - Road plates (orange stacked layers marker): A permanent hazard on the road
    - Temporary hazard (orange warning triangle marker): A temporary road hazard such as a fallen tree, downed power line, or traffic accident

**Note:** These hazards will appear on the map for all Supervisors and Drivers that are working in the same service area.
