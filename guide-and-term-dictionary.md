<section id="What-is-SNOWiQ" markdown="1">
## What is SNOWiQ?
    
SNOWiQ is a snowplow fleet management and reporting tool for municipalities, snow plow operators, and the public. Based on our TERRAiQ platform, SNOWiQ uses a combination of smartphone-based GPS and cloud technology, delivering a 360-degree view of individual contractor vehicles and your overall snow removal fleet, without costly hardware investments.  Your team and drivers simply log into the SNOWiQ app from the smartphones and devices they already own. SNOWiQ is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that combines your internal reporting needs with the convenience of a public dashboard—two mobile applications and a citizen web portal that satisfies all your vehicle tracking, business intelligence, and communication needs. SNOWiQ is designed to meet the unique needs of fleet supervisors, snowplow operators, and the public they serve.

**For Storm Operations Managers/Supervisors** - SNOWiQ’s easy-to-use application lets you visualize your contractor fleet in real-time, from city-wide fleet activity, down to individual neighborhoods. Prioritize fleet movements, dynamically assign, re-route, redeploy, or add drivers, from within the app. You can also enforce quality control, improve performance, time management, and customer service. 

**For Snowplow Operators** - Municipal and contractor drivers can use smartphones they already own to advertise their availability, receive notifications when routes are assigned to them, seamlessly switch to Google Maps for directions, and confirm when routes are completed.  

**For the Public** - SNOWiQ’s public portal provides residents and businesses with much-needed transparency into snow removal efforts. One portal shows when streets will be plowed, weather updates, and snow removal statistics.

<section id="Roles-in-SNOWiQ-SOC-User-Management" markdown="1">
## Roles in SNOWiQ (SOC-User Management)
<section id="Admin" markdown="1">
### Storm Operations Manager

The Admin (or Storm Operations Manager) - This user's primary role is to plan work on upcoming storm events. They are responsible for creating the events in the Snow Operations Center (SOC), along with setting up the phases for supervisors to create assignments for resources. They will mainly use the SNOWiQ SOC for planning and management.

</section>

<section id="Supervisor" markdown="1">
### Supervisor

Supervisors are managers over specific depots (potentially more than one) and are responsible for the management of phases and assignments. Supervisors also work with Storm Operations Managers during storm events planning to create phases and assignments. Supervisors have access to the SNOWiQ SOC for planning and the SNOWiQ Supervisor Application (SA) to create assignments, stop and start phases, and review tickets for assignment. Supervisors can only view routes assigned to their depot, which is automatically set to their default depot. Supervisors also manage their Contractor workforce.

</section>

<section id="Inspector" markdown="1">
### Inspector

Inspectors are responsible for the management of contractor resorces, route assignements of assignments, and ensuring the completion of those assignments by reviewing the work done by the drivers onsite when an assignment is completed. Inspectors primarily use the SNOWiQ Supervisor Application (SA).

Currently, Supervisors and Inspectors have the same application access (both SA and SOC). The difference is primarily in who they manage: Inspectors manage Contractors, Supervisors primarily manage employees, and Chief Supervisors are responsible for the whole Depot.
</section>

<section id="Contractor Manager" markdown="1">
### Contractor Manager

Contractor Manager - A Contractor Manager is an individual who represents a contracted company that acts as a resource to support Snow Storm Events on a part-time basis. The Contractor Manager has access to SOC and is responsible for managing a contractor's fleet, and is responsible for providing up-to-date equipment information and confirming truck availability.

</section>

<section id="Driver" markdown="1">
### Driver

Drivers are responsible for assignments sent to them by Storm Operations Managers, supervisors, or inspectors. This could include a pre-determined route, a specific address, or queued assignments for multiple phases during a storm event. Assignments may include plowing, salting, a combination of plowing and salting, or multi-pass assignments. Drivers will use the SNOWiQ Driver App on their mobile device to receive assignments and act on those assignments to completion.
</section>

<section id="Resident" markdown="1">
### Resident

Residents have the ability to log into the SNOWiQ Resident Portal to view statistics of the current storm event for the entire county, a specific service area (depot), or a route that their address is associated with. This allows users to get a better understanding of what actions are currently underway in reference to the current situation.
</section>
</section>

<section id="SNOWiQ-Vocabulary" markdown="1">
## SNOWiQ Vocabulary

<section id="Season" markdown="1">
### Season

When a Season is referenced in conjunction with SNOWiQ, it typically refers to a period of time in which there is an increased chance of snowfall in the area and that personnel should be available for snow cleanup and emergency request duties.
</section>

<section id="Event" markdown="1">
### Event

An Event is a single entity created by a Storm Operations Manager to create a plan for an upcoming snow storm (typically 1-2 weeks before the actual storm).
</section>

<section id="Phase" markdown="1">
### Phase

Phase - A Phase in SnowIQ is a timeframe used during a Storm Event to define certain activities to be performed by drivers. An example of a Phase would be 'Plowing' - a Phase with an Activity set to 'Plowing' would set all assignments to this activity and drivers included in this phase would need to plow their assigned routes. One phase must be completed before the next can begin, as they cannot overlap.
</section>

<section id="Depot" markdown="1">
### Depot

A Depot is a centralized hub that manages a number of routes in the service area. Typically, a single Supervisor manages a depot. A Depot can potentially have multiple Inspectors that manage individual routes within the service area.
</section>

<section id="Driver-1" markdown="1">
### Driver

See ‘Driver’ Definition under the ‘Roles’ section above. When logged into the app, Storm Operations Managers, supervisors, and inspectors will be able to see the driver markers on an interactive map along with their current status at the time (notated by a color specified in Status below). Employees can be found on the map with a circular snowplow marker while contractors will be found with a square marker.

<section id="Driver-Statuses" markdown="1">

<section id="Truck-1" markdown="1">
### Truck

Truck is a heavy vehicle equipment that has its profile in the system. All Truck profiles are created by Storm Operations Manager and stored in the system and can be managed in Truck Management module.

<section id="Truck-Statuses" markdown="1">

#### Truck Statuses

| Active | Truck successfully passed inspection and has been certified in the system. |
| Inactive | Truck has been uncertified because of a failed inspection. |

<section id="Resource-1" markdown="1">
### Resource

A Resource is composed of a Driver and a Truck. Resources are managed in the Storm Operation Center and Supervisor app. Resources can have different statuses depending on the Storm Event stage.

<section id="Resource-Checkin-Statuses" markdown="1">

#### Resource Check-in Statuses

| New |  Create a new resource, or import a resource from a previous event. |

</section>

<section id="Resource-Service-Statuses" markdown="1">

#### Resource Service Statuses

| Logged in (Contractor Only) | A Contractor is logged in to the system, but has not yet accepted any new assignments and is not working on any active assignments. This status is for drivers awaiting a new status after logging in. (This status means no payment is being calculated for the driver, whether they just logged on or have been released.) |
| StandBy (Contractor Only) | is for Contract Drivers who are in position, awaiting assignment. This status is applied manually to a driver by their supervisor. (This status allows for calculation of payment by half of their rate.) |
| Ready | is the default status for County Drivers after logging on. For Contract Drivers, it is applied manually by their supervisor to indicate that the driver is ready to begin work on another assignment. (This status allows for calculation of payment at the Contract Driver's full rate.) |
| In Service | is for Drivers who have accepted and started an assignment. |
| Paused | is for when a supervisor manually pauses a driver. This puts all assignments in the driver's queue on hold until the Supervisor resumes the driver manually. |
| Offline | is for users that are not logged into the SNOWiQ Driver Application, drivers that are out of range of the service area (out of range), or any drivers that are not able to broadcast/receive GPS coordinates to the system (out of service). |
